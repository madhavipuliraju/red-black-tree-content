Explanation: At every level we can form a tree with difference in height between subtrees to be atmost 1 and so there can be log(n) such levels since height of AVL tree is log(n).

                        <br>Ans. a<br> 
                        Explanation : In real world, dealing with random values is often not possible. The probability that you are dealing with non random values(like sequential) leads to mostly skew trees, which leads to the worst case. Hence we make the height balanced by rotations.

					Binary Search Tree in its worst case can can have a complexity of O(n) in insertion and deletion.

The Red-Black trees guarantee a O(log(n)) in insertion and deletion (even in worst case). 
They are balanced search trees and therefore balance themselves to always maintain a height of log(n).

                        Explanation : An extra attribute which is a color red or black is used. Root is black, because if it is red, then one of the red-black tree properties which states that number of black nodes from root to null nodes must be same, will be violated.

                        <br>Ans. a<br> 
                        Explanation : Though both trees are balanced, when there are more insertions and deletions to make the tree balanced, AVL trees should have more rotations, and hence it would be better to use red-black. But if more search operations are needed, AVL trees should be used.

                        <h2 class="hlongt">Deletion in a Red Black Tree</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="art-body">




                        Initially, we will delete a node just like we delete a node in a normal binary search tree. Here are the cases we will look at:<br>

1)<b> Red leaf node<br>
2) Black node, with one red child node<br>
3) Black leaf node</b><br>

In the first case, the normal binary search tree delete is sufficient. Removing a red node does not change the black depths of any node, nor does it create a red child for any red node.<br>

In the second case, after we complete the binary search tree delete, we must simply recolour the child node of the deleted node to black. Changing this color adds one to the black depths of each node in the subtree of the deleted node, restoring the equality of the black depths of all external nodes. Also, changing a node to black does not violate any of the other Red-Black Tree specifications.<br>

Neither of the strategies mentioned above are adequate for dealing with the third case. Instead, when we patch in the child of the deleted node in this case, in order to temporarily preserve the black depth property, we will colour this child node a fictitious "double black" color. <br>

Before we discuss how to deal with "double black" nodes, let's quickly justify why the cases above are the only cases we will deal with. First off, we will only delete nodes with 0 or 1 child. Neither coloured node can have one black child. If it did, the black height of the node's null child would not be proper. Furthermore, a red node can NOT have a red child. These observations narrow the cases to the situations listed above.<br>
The remaining cases with this "double black" node can be categorized as follows:<br>

1) The sibling of the "double black" node is black and has a red child.<br>
2) The sibling of the "double black" node is black and both children are black.<br>
3) The sibling of the "double black" node is red.<br>

(Note that initially, even though the double black node is a null node, after starting the recolouring/restructuring process, we may create a double black node that is NOT null)<br>

To deal with each of these situations, let's first set up names for all of the important nodes:<br>

1) Let the child of the deleted node, which is coloured "double black" be r.<br>
2) Let y be the sibling of r.<br>
3) Let z be a child of y, in each case, the specific child will be designated.<br>
4) Let x be the parent of y.<br>



<b>Case 1: </b>y is black and has a red child z.<br>

This case corresponds to the transfer operation in a 2-4 Tree delete. Take the nodes x, y, and z and relabel them as a, b, and c, in their inorder ordering. Place b where x used to be, and then have a and c be the left and right children of x, respectively. Colour a and c black, and color b whatever colour x USED to be. This eliminates the "double black" problem, so we can stop here.
<br>
<b>Case 2:</b> y is black and both of its children are as well.<br>

This case corresponds to a fusion operation in a 2-4 Tree. We deal with this case by just recolouring, instead of making any structural changes to the tree. In particular, we will colour r black, (changing it from "double black") and then colour y red. This subtracts one from the black depth of every external node in the subtree of x. To compensate for this, we must change x from red to black. BUT, this only works if x was red to begin with!!! If it's not, to maintain the "black depth" at the external nodes in the subtree rooted at x, we must colour x "double black." In essence, if this occurs, we have pushed the "double black" node up the tree, much like a fusion operation can propogate another fusion operation.

<!--                         Let <b>v</b> be the node to be deleted.
                        Let <b>u</b> be only the child  of v.
                        Case1. Either v or u is red
                        <ul>
                            <li>Replace v by u,u will be a black node</li>


                        </ul>
                        Case2. Both u and v are black.

                        <ul>
                            <li> If node u is root, make it a single black node</li>
                            <li> <b>NOTE</b>: This violates the property of red black trees,as number of black nodes from root to descendant nodes must be constant.Here earlier it was 2, but now it is reduced to 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>To overcome this we represent single node by a double black node, by depicting it with an extra black circle.</li>
                            <li>
                            The next task is to reduce this double black node to a single node.</li>
                       
                            <li> If u is a root node, we can directly reduce the double black node to a single black node</li>
                            <li>Else , we have 4 subcases to be handled.
                            </li>
                        






                        Let w be sibling node of w.
                        
                        If w is black and both the children of w are black.

                        Explanation : From the given preorder traversal, we know that the root of the tree is 'a'. Thus, 'a' must be the last element in the post order traversal. Now, after re-constructing the tree, we can easily find its post order traversal.
